# What make NEFARAM unique :
The world is deleveled, meaning enemies are as strong as they should be, independent of your own level. basically, every tool you as a player have, expect your enemies to potentially have them : skills, spells, potions, perks, etc

Each type of enemy and armor type has weaknesses and strenghs, meaning you cannot deal only one type of damage : dont expect to clear a nordic ruin full of undeads with only a bow ! Did I mention you can only regenerate health with potions or spells?

That brings us to the core of NEFARAM-combat: You need to delegate some parts of it to followers. You need a Tank to handle the melee enemies, a mage to ice those Dwemer centurions, perhaps a healer would be a good idea... You get the idea. Over time, you will be able to recruit more followers as your skill increases. But remember, this is a harsh world and almost nobody is your friend here...

# Main Mods you should know about

## Visuals
Based on [Animonculary Visual Overhaul 1.3](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Readme.md) (very gorgeous yet performance friendly) heavily modified.

## Combat
lots of tweaks with [Simonrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files), [Stamina matters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50502), [Smart NPC potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102) (with [animations !](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182)), [True Unleveled Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56881/), [NPCStatRescaler](https://github.com/theSkyseS/NPCStatRescaler) and more.

## Economy
A lot of mods to make the game's economy feel alive with prices fluctuations depending on a lot of factors. As you cannot invest in all skills you have opportunities for gold sinks to alleviates some of your weaknesses (No smithing? you can [order a new armor from a blacksmith](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51254) for example) as well as very creative loverslab money sinks...



## Quests
Many quests revamped : [Jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727?tab=user+files)'s quests, and tweaks to pretty much all of Skyrim's factions but the big ones are [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [Helgen Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673), [Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748/), [Penitus Oculatus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21061)

## Followers
3DNPCs, Inigo, Serana Add-On, Mythos, Lucien, Morgaine and lots of others...

## Armors & Outfits
Some new armors that are mostly variants of vanilla ones that i tried to keep "lore-friendly" and "immersive" as much as possible... Integrated into the game with custom rebalanced crafting costs and conditions, The skimpiness is mostly contained in a tasteful way to TAWOBA. All armors and outfits added are balanced and integrated into the world. That includes the Creation Club content.

## And More
Cities and landcapes overhauls, roleplay mods and animations...

# Important NSFW mods you should know about

## Disclamer

NO creature support

Non-consent(Rape) is limited-ish and you usually have a way avoid it and have trade-offs, but due to the sheer number of loverslab mods there might be some scenarios that slipped through. The main way is if you're defeated in combat or if you choose some specific start options, so if you wanna avoid it just dont die (and be rich). There is however slavery both of you and others but you will see it coming (more or less). There is however some coercion going on, which is considered rape IRL but different mechanics ingame.

## The mods
based on Sexlab Framework

OSL Aroused : your character can get horny. Lots of stuff tied to this so as an advice its best to try to keep it down if you dont want to have unwanted consequences...

Devious Devices : more of a framework for other mods but introduces bondage gear in Skyrim. I recommend you try to understand a bit how it works or it can become more frustrating than it is supposed to be.

Deviously Cursed Loot : Skyrim has always been plagued by rogue magic surrounding loot to ward off thiefs, but the spells have gone out of control and can now curse the naive (horny) adventurers... as you see, very lore friendly ! A lot of stuff disabled in the MCM of the modlist but you're welcome to reenable them if thats your wish. Basically : If your character is horny while opening a chest they have a chance to equip devious devices. To do the main quest of that mod, which I recommend to do once and only once, you need to go to Helgen and near the torture room to find Chloe.

Devious followers : You thought people would help you for free? They want a cut, and if you can't pay, they will find other ways to make you...

Milk Mod Economy : You can make milk and sell it.

Battlefuck : The defeat mod. All defeat mods are bugged but so far this is the one that works most IMO. You can safely disable it BEFORE you start a new game but once you play with it you're stuck with it ! When you reach 0 health against humanoid enemies you are downed. Your followers can revive you. If they also are downed or if you dont have any then theres a minigame to avoid being raped. If you fail you can also be robbed of your gold, items, and can faint. If you do, you wake up in random places with sometimes very game changing consequences (that are never good). So avoid dying. The mod is quite script heavy so sometimes you have to wait a bit before actions start being made.

Corruption : When they are hit hard by enemies, or when they get raped, your character can get traumatized. To lower that trauma they need to do addictive actions such as drink alcohol, skooma, various types of sex to lower that trauma. Thus they can get addicted to those actions in return, and even sometimes giving buffs ! However if your character is too far gone they will suffer debuffs when not doing those actions, sometimes very harsh ones. You can lower your corruption by praying.

Radiant Prostitution : You need to order that sword from Eorlund Gray-Mane, but he's asking for a lot of money, so you can save up for it the old-fashioned way. Includes add-on to make your follower your pimp.

Public Whore : same as above, but different. 

Sexlab Survival : LOTS of stuff here, also lots of stuff disabled by default in the modlist. But basically : Do something wrong in cities and suffer the consequences. and there are a lot more consequences than just a fine or jail... Also includes bikini system : you will progressively get buffs if you wear some but you will suffer debuffs if you wear regular armors again. You can enable some options back but it can get very intrusive.

Quests : Amorous adventures, Book of Mara, Sister of Dibella, and some vanilla ones tweaked to include the possibility of sex. The big one is Trouble of Heroine, it adds NPCs with more or less big quests (like 3DNPCs) but it is optional because it is perhaps the most extreme one in this modlist (humiliation, rape, the whole shebang). By default I disabled the ones I tested that I found borderline or too annoying. However among all of this there is some good stuff in there.

Sexual Fame Comments : NPCs will gossip and react on what you do around them.

Lots of ambiant stuff surrounding the dark and harsh society that is Skyrim during a civil war.

### About immersion
I tried to keep all the mods above as integrated as possible into the game and not feel too out of place, but some of them would require extensive patching to remove the way out there stuff (looking at you DCL), so some things like dialogue or some Devious Devices outfits can feel out of place but the trade-off is usually worth it.


## Final Steps - Ingame
### Initial Actions
After creating your character (NEEDS to be a woman), wait until there's no more messages appearing on the top left (can take a couple minutes). Then Go to MCM>MCM Recorder>Click on NEFARAM and follow the Instructions>Click Run Recording. You will get messages on the top left again and even some popups appearing. This part can take several minutes, And even if nothing seems to be happening, something is happening. Wait until the Popup "NEFARAM has finished playing" appears.

### Some functions could not be recorded to MCM Recorder, so you have to do it manually :
MCM>Wetfuction Redux>Target>Select target (your character name)>Then a bit under Start Effect

### Final notes :
You can modify your body type with OBody (Press F10). You can add your own custom CBBE 3BA body preset into ModOrganizer and it'll work out of the box, no need to rerun Bodyslide.

All debug spells are located in your Powers Keyring Power

The Notification Log MCM is very useful to read what you might've missed ingame.

### DONE ! You can save and never have to do this again ! Unless you update the list of course ;)

## Known Bugs
The list is stable and you should not have too many CTDs however as I couldnt test thoroughly all the quests I put in there, so there might be some bugs there (especially the loverlab quests, full of good ideas but the execution is variable). If you report those to me I can help and incorporate the bugfixes into next releases.

Fighting with the arms bounds has funky animations because Devious Devices was made for FNIS and this modlist uses Nemesis.

Some clothes which are supposed to be translucent sometimes have weird reflections or opacity due to ENB light at night or in interiors.

Schlongs of Skyrim can interfere with some underwear (phantom dick bug).

When you want to dismiss a follower sometimes they are not dismissed, thats because they are still a Devious Follower. I need to manually patch all dialogues... Ill get around to it someday.
