NEFARAM is a unique NSFW modlist with lots of new content balanced around a deleveled world. Experience a hardcore in every sense of the term yet rewarding new Skyrim !

# Installation

# What make NEFARAM unique :
Skyrim is a harsh medieval place. You will need to fight, help, convince, escape, coerce both friends and foes to survive. Inspired by Requiem, expect an unforgiving world at your reach. But full of opportunities if you manage to seize them...

The world is deleveled, meaning enemies are as strong as they should be, independent of your own level. basically, every tool you as a player have, expect your enemies to potentially have them : skills, spells, potions, perks, etc. If you have a light armor on and you dont dodge/block a greatsword, you will probably die no matter what.

Each type of enemy and armor type has weaknesses and strenghs, meaning you cannot deal only one type of damage : dont expect to clear a nordic ruin full of undeads with only a bow ! Did I mention you can only regenerate health with potions or spells?

That brings us to the core of NEFARAM-combat: You need to delegate some parts of it to followers. You need a Tank to handle the melee enemies, a mage to ice those Dwemer centurions, perhaps a healer would be a good idea... Followers are the only people that will evolve at the same pace as you. You get the idea. But remember, this is a harsh world and almost nobody is your friend here...


# Main Mods you should know about

Full modlist : [Click Here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/nefaram)

## Visuals
Based on [Animonculary Visual Overhaul 1.3](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Readme.md) (very gorgeous yet performance friendly) heavily modified.

## Combat
lots of tweaks with [Simonrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files), [Stamina Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50502), [Smart NPC potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102) (with [animations !](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182)), [True Unleveled Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56881/), [NPCStatRescaler](https://github.com/theSkyseS/NPCStatRescaler). For the combat feeling, expect it to be slower but more impacting than vanilla.

## Quests
Many quests revamped : [Jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727?tab=user+files)'s quests, and tweaks to pretty much all of Skyrim's factions but the big ones are [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [Helgen Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673), [Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748/), [Penitus Oculatus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21061), [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), and im planning on adding more but slowly to make sure they integrate well.

## Followers
[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194/), [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461), [Serana Add-On](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161), [Mythos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51576?tab=posts), [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035), [Morgaine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41027),[Misty Skye ( (｡)(｡) )](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16374?tab=description) and some others...

## Armors & Outfits
Vanilla outfits remodeled, and new ones that i tried to keep "lore-friendly" and "immersive" as much as possible... And they are pretty much all custom integrated into the game with crafting costs, conditions. The skimpiness is mostly contained in a tasteful way. They are also balanced and integrated into the world, like in chests, vendors, or worn by people. That includes the Creation Club content. Im open to suggestions though I need to integrate each item manually so I go slowly on that.

## Economy
A lot of mods to make the game's economy feel alive with [prices fluctuations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26325) depending on a lot of [factors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081). As you cannot invest in all skills you have opportunities for gold sinks to alleviates some of your weaknesses (No smithing? you can [order a new armor from a blacksmith](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51254) for example) as well as very creative loverslab money sinks...

*(BETA comment: need feedback on the economy of Honed Metal, is it too cheap or expensive to get good items?)*

## Other mods to be aware of :
[Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414), [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)

Survival is an important aspect of this modlist, but your whole gameplay will not revolve around it if you plan a bit in advance.

## User Interface
[Dear Diary Dark mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837),[TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775) and others (see images at the bottom for example)

## And More
[Lots](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37982) of [cities](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731) and [villages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977) and landcapes overhauls, new [interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130) roleplay mods and animations... There is a lot of things that will be new and yet consistent with the game, to make hopefully one of the most fresh Skyrim experiences.

# Important NSFW mods you should know about

## Disclamer

NO creature support.

There is no mods for posing/screen archery. This is a modlist made for gameplay first and foremost but you can add your own pose mods if ya want.

Non-consent(Rape) (In PEGI 18 version) is limited-ish and you usually have a way avoid it and have trade-offs, but due to the sheer number of loverslab mods there might be some scenarios that slipped through. Usually if you notice a typo in dialogue that will lead to one of the loverslab mod with a sex scene... The main way is if you're defeated in combat or if you choose some specific start options, so if you wanna avoid it just dont die (and be rich). There is however slavery both of you and others but you will see it coming (more or less). There is however lots of coercion going on, which is considered rape IRL but different mechanics ingame.

The situations depicted in the modlist do not represent any resemblance to reality and are obviously a fantasy and should stay that way.

## The mods
based on Sexlab Framework, with lots of new animations.

I recommend reading a bit on each modpage here, I put small descriptions but there is no details.

[OSL Aroused](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65454) : your character can get horny. Lots of stuff tied to this so as an advice its best to try to keep it down if you dont want to have unwanted consequences...

[Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/15078-devious-devices-le-50/) : more of a framework for other mods but introduces bondage gear in Skyrim. I recommend you try to understand a bit how it works or it can become more frustrating than it is supposed to be. CUSTOM CHANGES : You buy and sell the devices to merchants (see bug list at the bottom tho)

[Devious Enchanted Chests](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/1405-deviously-enchanted-chests/) : If you open chests they have a chance to be trapped and equip bondage gear on your character.

[Devious followers](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11732-devious-followers-continued-se/) : You thought people would help you for free? They want a cut, and if you can't pay, they will find other ways to make you... CUSTOM CHANGES: custom armors considered 'pretty' for the deal: TAWOBA,TEWOBA,Ninirim Lingerie

[Milk Mod Economy](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6103-milk-mod-economy-se/) : You can make milk and sell it. CUSTOM CHANGES: removed the scripted 'economy' part of the mod, when you made your milk just can just sell it to merchants, the values are tweaked.

[Yamete Kudasai](https://www.patreon.com/posts/yamete-kudasai-0-67182401) : The defeat mod. still in beta rn but seems solid. Theres other alternatives included in the modlist as optional but remember, once you start with a defeat mod, you need to keep it the whole game.

[Corruption](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/15787-corruption/) : When you are hit hard by enemies, or when you get raped, your character can get traumatized. To lower that trauma you need to do addictive actions such as drink alcohol, skooma, various types of sex to lower that trauma. Thus your haracter can get addicted to those actions in return, and even sometimes giving buffs ! However if your character is too far gone they will suffer debuffs when not doing those actions, sometimes very harsh ones. You can lower your corruption by praying.

*(BETA comment: need feedback for the balance of that also)*

[Radiant Prostitution](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/17325-radiant-prostitution-gigolo-se/) : Talk to innkeepers, they have several new jobs for you... included patch to make follower be able to give jobs too. CUSTOM CHANGES: 'Working clothes': Ninirim Lingerie, Some of Ghaan craftable

[Public Whore](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/17026-public-whore/) : same as above, but different. 

[Sexlab Survival](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5914-sexlab-survival/)(modpage is outdated, version in the modlist 0.685) : LOTS of stuff here, also lots of stuff disabled by default in the modlist. But basically : Do something wrong in cities and suffer the consequences. and there are a lot more consequences than just a fine or jail... Also includes bikini system : you will progressively get buffs if you wear some but you will suffer debuffs if you wear regular armors again. You can enable some options back but it can get very intrusive (and also buggy). CUSTOM CHANGE : Armors considered Bikini : TAWOBA,TEWOBA, some others

Quests : [Amorous adventures](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/109518-amorous-adventures-34-sse-for-lovers-lab/), [Book of Mara](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10091-the-book-of-sex-se/), [Sister of Dibella](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/120107-skyrimlldeepbluefrog-mods-conversion-to-sse/page/93/#comment-3462553), and some vanilla ones tweaked to include the possibility of sex. The big one is [Trouble of Heroine](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10454-troubles-of-heroine/), it adds NPCs with more or less big quests (like 3DNPCs) but it is optional *(BETA comment: no its not)* because it is perhaps the most extreme one in this modlist (humiliation, rape, the whole shebang) and also lots of typos. By default I disabled the ones I tested that I found borderline or too annoying. However among all of this there is some good stuff in there. Aslo [Angrim's Apprentice](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/384-angrims-apprentice-feb-10-2016/). CUSTOM CHANGES: patches for sunhelm, Milkmod, also some balance.

[Sexual Fame Comments](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14089-slsf-fame-comments-se/) : NPCs will gossip and react on what you do around them.

[Simple Slavery](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/13531-simple-slavery-plus-plus/) : You have a chance to be enslaved if you're defeated in combat, and also some other (rare) ways.

[Paradise Halls](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6305-paradise-halls-enhanced-pahe-special-edition-with-the-customary-addons/) & [Diary of Mine](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16941-paradise-halls-diary-of-mine-wip/) : YOU can enslave people, train them and make them fighters or sell them for money. at a slave auction west of Fellglow Keep. CUSTOM CHANGES : removed some dialogues from Diary of Mine.

Aaand lots of ambiant stuff surrounding the dark and harsh society that is Skyrim during a civil war.

### About immersion
I tried to keep all the mods above as integrated as possible into the game and not feel too out of place, but some of them would require extensive patching to remove the way out there stuff, so some things like dialogue or some Devious Devices outfits can feel out of place but the trade-off is usually worth it.

## Game Pre-launch
### Choose your version
There are 2 version : [PEGI 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkoUQAvYkVI) and [PEGI 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQYJHUJlYE).

Choose the one you want in MO2 profiles. The differences are that these mods and their corresponding patch are disabled in the PEGI 16 version : Trouble of Heroine, Hydra slavegirls, Damsels in distress, Public Whore, Simple Slavery, Paradise Halls, Diary Of Mine

*BETA Comment : No PEGI 16 yet*

### Final notes and tips :
*BETA COMMENT : Save often :')*

You can modify your body type with [OBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51084) (Press F10). Or others people's bodies male or female if you aim at them with your crosshair.

All debug spells are located in your Powers Keyring Power

The [Notification Log](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27707) MCM is very useful to read what you might've missed ingame.

You can hide quests you dont want to do with [Hide your quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50125).

Press G for the Survival Wheel, with tons of useful actions to do.

Feel free to edit the MCMs of mods, most do not pose issues apart from gameplay and balance changes, but do so at your own risk, for example if you reenable decapitations in violens you have a 50% chance to also decapitate your PC when you decapitate someone (CTD)

### DONE ! You can save and never have to do this again ! Unless you update the list of course ;)

## Known Bugs
The list is stable and you should not have too many CTDs however as I couldnt test thoroughly all the quests I put in there, so there might be some bugs there (especially the loverlab quests, full of good ideas but the execution is variable). If you report those to me I can help and incorporate the bugfixes into next releases.

Fighting with the arms bounds has funky animations because Devious Devices was made for FNIS and this modlist uses Nemesis.

Schlongs of Skyrim can interfere with some underwear if you put them on males (phantom dick bug).

When you want to dismiss a follower sometimes they are not dismissed, thats because they are still a Devious Follower. Mods using custom followers are the culprit of this, you can use the Devious Followers MCM to force remove your follower once you paid them in full.

If you try to sell equipped devious devices to merchants, you get the money and keep the device. So infinite money. Just refrain yourself from doing it.

The dialogue camera is sometimes bugged when you talk to the statue of mara in the beginning, but that fixes itself when you enter the real world.

When you first start your game animations will take a few seconds to register (T-Pose on NPCs). That is normal.
