

here are the most advanced where I patched the mods, especially quest requirements to craft the outfits. The changes not mentioned are logical (eg: to craft a glass armor variant from a mod you need the corresponding perk). Without any perk you can craft any iron/hide outfits and weapons, including modded ones. Keep in mind this is only to craft them, you can aquire some of them at vendors or enemies.
