# Preamble
NEFARAM is the next level of Skyrim NSFW modlists. With lots of new content, experience a hardcore in every sense of the term, but rewarding new Skyrim !

Skyrim is now a true harsh medieval place. You will need to fight, help, convince, escape, coerce both friends and foes to survive. Inspired by Requiem, expect an unforgiving world at your reach. But full of opportunities if you manage to seize them...

The philosophy NEFARAM is tough, but fair, on every aspect of the game.

For combat, enemies are as strong as they should be. Basically, every tool you as a player have, expect your enemies to potentially have them : skills, spells, potions, perks, etc. If you have a light armor on and you dont dodge/block a greatsword, you will not have a good time no matter what's your level ! Each type of enemy and armor type has weaknesses and strenghs, meaning you cannot deal only one type of damage : dont expect to clear a nordic ruin full of undeads with only a bow ! Did I mention you can only regenerate health with potions or spells? The modlist contains a carefully and manually added dose of new armors and clothes, you can see the list [here](https://github.com/ConsolidatedSky/NEFARAM/blob/main/NEFARAM_Crafts.txt).

That brings us to the core of NEFARAM-combat: You need to delegate some parts of it to followers. You need a Tank to handle the melee enemies, a mage to ice those Dwemer centurions, perhaps a healer would be a good idea... Followers are the only people that will evolve at the same pace as you. You get the idea. But remember, this is a harsh world and almost nobody is your friend here...

Lots of new quests, places and people to meet !

Inspired by the now defunct modlist Dungeons & Deviousness, but slightly less devious (or at least in a different way ;) )

Based on [Animonculory Visual Overhaul Version 1.3](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul#readme). 

# Main Mods you should know about

Full modlist : [Click Here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/nefaram)

### Visuals
Based on [Animonculary Visual Overhaul 1.3](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Readme.md) (very gorgeous yet performance friendly) modified.
This modslits uses [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861) a bunch of complimentary mods that will truly change the atmosphere in game. Each season last 30 days, so you will be able to experience them all in your playthrough.

### Combat
[Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741?tab=description)
lots of tweaks with [Simonrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files), [NPCs use potions]([https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67489)) (with [animations !](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182)), [NPCStatRescaler](https://github.com/theSkyseS/NPCStatRescaler), [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347?tab=description). For the combat feeling, expect it to be slower but more impacting than vanilla.

Other important ones : [Know Your Enemy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13807), [Potion Toxicity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32576)

### Quests
Big ones are [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [Chanterelle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32603), [Helgen Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673), [Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748/), [Penitus Oculatus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21061), [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), [Saints & Seducers Extended Cut](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) and im planning on adding more but slowly to make sure they integrate well.

Many quests revamped : [Jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727?tab=user+files)'s quests, and tweaks to pretty much all of Skyrim's factions

### Followers
[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194/), [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461), [Serana Add-On](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161), [Mythos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51576?tab=posts), [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035), [Morgaine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41027),[Misty Skye ( (｡)(｡) )](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16374?tab=description), [Katana](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622?tab=description), [Daegon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78745?tab=description) and some others...

### Armors & Outfits
Vanilla outfits remodeled, and new ones that i tried to keep "lore-friendly" and "immersive" as much as possible... And they are pretty much all custom integrated into the game with crafting costs, conditions. Basically, armors look like 'real' armors on both genders, but some of the clothing can be skimpy. They are also balanced and integrated into the world, like in chests, vendors, or worn by people. That includes the Creation Club content. You an also now craft most vanilla clothes, and usually you can make them in a skimpy/alternative variant on a tanning rack if you have the original.

### Economy
A lot of mods to make the game's economy feel alive with [prices fluctuations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26325) depending on a lot of [factors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081). As you cannot invest in all skills you have opportunities for gold sinks to alleviates some of your weaknesses (No smithing? you can [order a new armor from a blacksmith](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51254) for example) as well as very creative loverslab money sinks...

### Player Homes
[Improved Vanilla Ones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37236) + Creation Club houses with a couple mods to make them better. The costs in particular are higher.

### Other mods to be aware of :
[Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414), [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)

Survival is an important aspect of this modlist, but your whole gameplay will not revolve around it if you plan a bit in advance. Do note that a lot of the placed food in the world is removed, you will no longer find centuries old bread in your nordic crypts.

### User Interface
[Dear Diary Dark mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837),[TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775) and others (see images at the bottom for example). Also [iEquip](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27008)

### And More
[Lots](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37982) of [cities](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731) and [villages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977) and landcapes overhauls, new [interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130) roleplay mods and animations... There is a lot of things that will be new and yet consistent with the game, to make hopefully one of the most fresh Skyrim experiences. Did you say you want to [become a bard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50357) ?

# Sex part

### Disclamer

NOW WITH creature support.

Non-consent(Rape) is limited-ish and you usually have a way avoid it and have trade-offs, but due to the sheer number of loverslab mods there might be some scenarios that slipped through. Usually if you notice a typo in dialogue that will lead to one of the loverslab mod with a sex scene... There is however slavery both of you and others but you will see it coming (more or less).

You need to be at least 18 Years Old to play the modlist.

There are no mods for posing/screen archery. This is a modlist made for gameplay first and foremost but you can add your own pose mods if ya want.

The situations depicted in the modlist do not represent any resemblance to reality and are obviously a fantasy and should stay that way.

### The mods
based on Sexlab Framework, with lots of new animations.

I recommend reading a bit on each modpage here, I put small descriptions but there is no details. Some descriptions are annoted 'CUSTOM CHANGES', that means once you've read the modpage descriptions then read what I added and you will understand more.

[OSL Aroused](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65454) : your character can get horny. Lots of stuff tied to so its more of a framework. Your arousal level appears on the bottom left of the HUD.

[Sexlab Separate Orgasms](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5929-sexlab-separate-orgasm-se/) : Minigame during sex scenes. (check Keyboard layout below)

[Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/15078-devious-devices-le-50/) : more of a framework for other mods but introduces bondage gear in Skyrim. I recommend you try to understand a bit how it works or it can become more frustrating than it is supposed to be. CUSTOM CHANGES : You can buy and sell the devices to merchants (see bug list at the bottom tho)

[Devious Enchanted Chests](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/1405-deviously-enchanted-chests/) : If you open chests they have a chance to be trapped and equip bondage gear on your character.

[Yamete Kudasai](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/23123-yamete-kudasai/) : The defeat mod. When you reach 0 health, various things will happen to you.

[Devious Lore](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16231-devious-lore-se) : adds NPCs that an help take off your devices, as well as some other ways to get some equipped. supposedly also adds some quests but I've had yet to play them as they're quite hard to start.

[Devious followers](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11732-devious-followers-continued-se/) : You thought people would help you for free? They want a cut, and if you can't pay, they will find other ways to make you... CUSTOM CHANGES: custom armors considered 'pretty' for the deal: TAWOBA,TEWOBA,Ninirim Lingerie

[Submissive Lola](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/15346-submissive-lola-the-resubmission-lese/) : Similar to Devious followers, but less about money and more about Sub/Dom relations. This one will not begin without you seing it coming, contrary to above.

[Milk Mod Economy](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6103-milk-mod-economy-se/) : You can make milk and sell it. CUSTOM CHANGES: removed the 'economy' part of the mod, when you made your milk just sell it to merchants, the values are tweaked.

[Sexlab Survival](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5914-sexlab-survival/) (modpage is outdated, version in the modlist 0.685) : LOTS of stuff here, also lots of stuff disabled by default in the modlist. But basically : Do something wrong in cities and suffer the consequences. and there are a lot more consequences than just a fine or jail... You can enable some options back but it can get very intrusive (and also buggy). CUSTOM CHANGE : Armors considered Bikini : TAWOBA,TEWOBA, some others

[Sexual Fame Comments](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14089-slsf-fame-comments-se/) : NPCs will gossip and react on what you do around them.

[Radiant Prostitution](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/17325-radiant-prostitution-gigolo-se/) : Talk to innkeepers, they have several new jobs for you... included patch to make follower be able to give jobs too. CUSTOM CHANGES: 'Working clothes': Ninirim Lingerie, Some of Ghaan craftable.

[Public Whore](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/17026-public-whore/) : kind of same as above, but more hardcore.

[Simple Slavery](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/13531-simple-slavery-plus-plus/) : Framework to get enslaved in other mods. Right now its quite difficult to become enslaved unless you do it manually. You can manually enslave yourself for a truly hardcore start if thats your thing in the MCM.

[Paradise Halls](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6305-paradise-halls-enhanced-pahe-special-edition-with-the-customary-addons/) & [Diary of Mine](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16941-paradise-halls-diary-of-mine-wip/) : YOU can capture people, train them and make them fighters or sell them for money. at a slave auction west of Fellglow Keep. Talk to Olava for a tutorial quest. CUSTOM CHANGES : removed some dialogues from Diary of Mine to declutter it a bit. To capture NPCs, use the interface from [Yamete Kudasai](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/23123-yamete-kudasai/).

And quests : [Amorous adventures](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/109518-amorous-adventures-34-sse-for-lovers-lab/), [Book of Mara](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10091-the-book-of-sex-se/), [Sisters of Dibella](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/120107-skyrimlldeepbluefrog-mods-conversion-to-sse/page/93/#comment-3462553), and some vanilla ones tweaked to include the [possibility](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10742-sexlab-solutions-revisited-se/) of sex. The big one is [Trouble of Heroine](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10454-troubles-of-heroine/), it adds NPCs with more or less big quests (like 3DNPCs) but it is optional because it is perhaps the most extreme one in this modlist (humiliation, rape, the whole shebang) and also lots of typos. By default I disabled the ones I tested that I found borderline or too annoying, but its a very large mod. However among all of this there is some good stuff in there. CUSTOM CHANGES: patches for Sunhelm, Milkmod, also some balance. You need to be Dragonborn officially for much of the quests to start.

Aaand lots of ambiant stuff surrounding the dark and harsh society that is Skyrim during a civil war.

### About immersion
I tried to keep all the mods above as integrated as possible into the game and not feel too out of place, but some of them would require extensive patching to remove the way out there stuff, so some things like dialogue or some Devious Devices outfits can feel out of place but the trade-off is usually worth it.

# Installation

It is recommended to have have Nexus Premium, or you will have to do a lot of clicking ! If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### Requirements
Latest Version of Skyrim Anniversary Edition WITH all the paid Creation Club content : >>>> [THIS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/) <<<<

Check the [AVO Systems requirements](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/edit/main/Readme.md#system-requirements).
NEFARAM requires a bit more CPU power than that, expect it to be ~20% more resource demanding than AVO.

Increase your pagefile (recommended : 40 GB).

Size : 163 GB ( and another 95 for the downloads). Put the modlist on an SSD please.

Wide Screens not tested.

Made for keyboard playing.

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing NEFARAM, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable),
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Reinstall Skyrim **in english language** into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location.
5. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
6. You also need to start the games to the main menu in order to download all the creations.
7. You need to have a [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/) account

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

#### Downloading and Installing NEFARAM

Downloading and installing NEFARAM can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer.

1. Open [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/), login to Nexus and Loverslab using the gear on top of the window.
1. Click 'Browse Modlists', tick 'Show Unofficial Lists' and search for NEFARAM, and download it. Alternatively you can download it from the Nexus page.
3. click on install from disc.
4. Select the .wabbajack file you previously downloaded.
5. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\NEFARAM. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
6. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster
7. Press the play button to begin.
8. Some mods from Loverslab will have to be manually downloaded. Either do it via Wabbajack or you will find a complete list on the discord server.
9. If you have Nexus Premium you can just let it process (around 90 GB of files to download), if you're not then you need to get clicking !
10. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [Final Steps](#final-steps). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

#### Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.

- Unable to download Tools_HavokBehaviorPostProcess_readme.txt (GameFileSourceDownloader+State|SkyrimSpecialEdition|1.6.353.0|tools\havokbehaviorpostprocess\readme.txt)
	- Install the [Creation Kit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/)

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:
	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file which is needed for Mod Organizer. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

# Final Steps
1. Open ModOrganizer.exe in the main folder of the modlist
2. Click on 'Play NEFARAM' on the top right when you're ready !
3. And finally load the savegame called 'NEFARAM_(Version)'. Press Enter when you're in the game, after that instructions will be on screen. The mod uses [Skyrim Unbound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962?tab=description). I recommend you read the decription.

## Final notes and tips (VERY IMPORTANT READ ALL) :

#### please read everything below so at least it will be in the back of your head when you play.
To play a male gender character, do the following :
1. Create your character
2. Press 'Stay Here'
3. Press Escape > Mod Configuration > MCM Recorder > MALE CHARACTER
4. Follow the instructions. You will get popups just click OK on them all.
5. Done !

I recommend to play as dragonborn in the Skyrim Unbound MCM, because a lot of NPCs and Quests will still reference you as dragonborn, unless you can make some RP about it (Some of the new followers can 'act' as Dragonborn as you will discover... ).

You can modify your body type with [OBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51084) (Press F10). Or others people's bodies man or woman if you aim at them with your crosshair.

In the Sexlab MCM you can set the sexual orientation of your character.

All debug spells are located in your [Powers Keyring](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42949) Power.

Temper or have someone temper your weapons, or they can break !

The [Notification Log](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27707) MCM is very useful to read what you might've missed ingame.

You can hide quests you dont want to do with [Hide your quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50125).

Press G for the Survival Wheel, with tons of useful actions to do. The 'Status' one especially.

Children are disabled by default, if you want to re-enable them like for the aretino quest go to MCM > Sex Lab - Sexual Fame > Base Settings > Uncheck disable children.

I removed most weird conditions like books to craft armors from mods or chests with the armors placed in the world : you usually need just the right smithing perk and sometimes a quest completed ([Stormcloak gear](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60530) if you join the stormcloaks, [Brotherhood bandoliers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67796) if you join them etc...), at merchants, or worn by NPCs. [Here](https://github.com/ConsolidatedSky/NEFARAM/blob/main/NEFARAM_Crafts.txt) is the full list of changes.

If you have some devices you can't take off talk to blacksmiths or to jailmasters in city jails.

Feel free to edit the MCMs of mods, most do not pose issues apart from gameplay and balance changes, Like Sexlab Survival, by default I disabled something like 80% of the mod but you can reenable them, but be warned it becomes hardcore very quickly. However modify them at your own risk, for example if you reenable decapitations in Violens you will crash :)

If suddenly you can't advance the main quest, it is due to [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704)

Save often but not too much : **avoid saving during combat or just before you load through a door**. F5 now does a full save.

When you want to dismiss a follower sometimes they are not dismissed, thats because they are still a Devious Follower. Mods using custom followers are the culprit of this, you can use the Devious Followers MCM to force remove your follower once you paid them in full.

#### You're DONE ! You can finally play :)

# Known Bugs
You should not have too many CTDs except in dense NPC areas however as I couldnt test thoroughly all the quests I put in there, so there might be some bugs there (especially the loverlab quests, full of good ideas but the execution is variable).

Fighting with the arms bound has funky animations because Devious Devices was made for FNIS and this modlist uses Nemesis.

If you try to sell equipped devious devices to merchants, you get the money and keep the device. So infinite money. So don't cheat. Or do it, its your game.

When you first start your game animations will take a few seconds to register (T-Pose on NPCs). That is normal. If the legs move, you are good.

# Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating unless you add [NoDelete] in front of your custom mods' names.
