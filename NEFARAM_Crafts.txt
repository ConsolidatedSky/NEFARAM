Here are the most advanced changes where I patched the mods, especially quest requirements to craft the outfits.
The changes not mentioned are logical (eg: to craft a glass armor variant from a mod you need the corresponding perk).
Without any perk you can craft any iron/hide level outfits and weapons, including modded ones.
Keep in mind this is only to craft them, you can aquire some of them at vendors or enemies.
Press Ctrl+F to search for an outfit in particular.
